## Development

Assuming the Sanity project is already set up:
1. `npm install`
2. `npx sanity login`, and login to the account that has the project.
3. `npm start`

Most errors with the Sanity CLI can be fixed by logging out and logging back in.

## Sanity Project Setup

1. `npm install -D @sanity/cli`
2. `npx sanity login`
3. `npx sanity init`
